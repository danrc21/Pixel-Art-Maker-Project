I have made my grid using the inbuilt insertRow and insertcell method for JaveScript. When the user clicks to add in the color on each cell, I have added the ability to drag the mouse and draw also, but only when the mouse down event occurs. I changed the CSS to have a color changing background as well as the background color and border of each cell in the table. For the HTML, I added an id for the submit input, "submitButton" to allow the user to change and erase the grid only when submit is clicked. I kept seeing the grid come up ad then disappear so I used event.preventDefault(): to prevent an automatic reset for the grid each time the submit button is click, i'm not 100% on this but hopefully it stays.
